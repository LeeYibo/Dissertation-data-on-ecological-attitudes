Based on the research subject, which examined the impact of environmental education at Chinese universities on college students' environmental a  ttitudes, the topics included in the scales for this study were derived from earlier research and were suitably changed to meet the specific context of the study. Environmental attitudes (EA), subjective norms (SN), perceived behavioral control (PBC), and school curriculum education (SCE) were the four dimensions of the study. Respondents indicated their degree of agreement with the statements on a scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree) for each of the questionnaire's five-point Likert scale items. In this study, the questionnaire was administered to the respondents through an online format and the respondents were prompted to give informed consent before completing the research questionnaire; therefore, the form of obtaining consent was electronic. No minors participated in the study.
